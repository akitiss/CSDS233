I added to class Node.java for the BinarySearchTree to reference

I made all the functions in BinarySearchTree non-static since I thought it would be cleaner via that way compared to putting in the input which tree it was. 

I created the function inOrder and the helper method inOrderString since in-order traversal returns the bst in chronological order.
I was able to use this to help with my kth biggest function. 
I also created two functions for this since inOrderString returns the bst as a sorted string, but inOrder converts this value into an array
